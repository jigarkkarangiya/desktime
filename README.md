## Uninstallation

Remove the tool completely:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jigarkkarangiya/desktime/main/desktime-uninstall.sh | bash
```

This removes the binary and cleans up configuration files.

## How It Works

The tool intelligently determines your first login time using multiple methods:

1. **System logs** - Checks authentication logs across different distributions
2. **System commands** - Uses `who`, `last`, and other utilities as fallbacks
3. **Graceful defaults** - Provides reasonable estimates when data is unavailable

The tool handles different Linux distributions, log formats, and permission scenarios automatically.

---

## Requirements

- Linux system (Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, Debian, etc.)
- `bash` shell 
- `curl` or `wget` for installation
- Standard Unix utilities (`date`, `awk`, `grep`)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found after installation

Restart your terminal or run:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Incorrect times displayed

If times seem wrong, the tool may be using fallback data. This can happen when:
- System logs are not accessible
- You haven't logged in through the normal authentication system
- The system clock is incorrect

The tool will still provide useful estimates in these scenarios.
